# MBModManager
MBMod Manager is a way for users to install mods and manage them without the hassle of manually do it. We designed this application to work closely with
https://mods-monbazou.amenofisch.dev. You will also be able to drag-n-drop Game Saves in future versions, however you will not have the same control as
you do with the mods and their dependencies.
